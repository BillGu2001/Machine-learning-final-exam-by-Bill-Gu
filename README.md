# Codes of the 7th and 9th question
Directory "第七题" consists of two files "Hopfield.py" and "SAA.py". "Hopfield.py" provides a solution to TSP by Hopfield neural network, while "SAA.py" provides a solution to TSP by simulate anneal arithmetic.

Directory "第九题" consists of six code files, eight directories of data, three pickle files and one M file saving the trained model. 
The six code files should be run in such order: 
"sample_arranging.py"->
"data_cleaning.py"->
"create_word_dict.py"->
"feature_constructing.py"->
"model_train_eval.py"->
"spam_detector"
